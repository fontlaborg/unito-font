My Unito font without Hangul, Tangut and Han has 35,693 glyphs, with 29,842 slots remaining. 

- Hangul adds 11,686 (= 47,379). 
- Tangut adds 6,914 (= 54,293). 

So if I don’t include Hangul, I can fit up to 29,842 glyphs. 
If I include Hangul but don’t include Tangut, I can fit up to 18,156 glyphs. 
If I include Hangul and Tangut, 11,242. 

I’d like to create variant fonts with Han glyphs for SC (Simplified Chinese), JP (Japanese), TC (Traditional Chinese), and optionally also KR (Korean) and HK (Hong Kong) variants if they’re really necessary. Some of these fonts may include Tangut (so only 11K Han glyphs) and some perhaps would not include Tangut (then I can put 18K glyphs). Point me to the modern (2026) standards, and also popular and "minimal mandatory" standards, and explain the standards. Also give me pointers about where to look for detailed character set definitions (preferably in Adobe Cmap form). 

How many forms are actually shared vs. divergent between these regions in, say, Adobe Source Han Sans? 

KR: 35,693 = Source Hangul 12,544 + HanKR 8,377 + Tangut 6,914 = 63,528! 
TW: 35,693 + Source HanTW 17,551 + Hangul 12,544 = 64,930
HK: 35,693 + Source HanHK 17,743 + Hangul 12,544 = 65,122
JP: 35,693 + Source HanJP 14,734 + Hangul 12,544 = 62,113
CN: 35,693 + Source HanCN 27,860 = 63,553
